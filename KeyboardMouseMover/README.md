# KeyboardMouseMover
**Windows utility that lets you move your mouse cursor with numpad buttons on the keyboard.**

## Why?
⚠️ **This project may not be useful for you...**

I made this to work well with the specific keyboard I'm using which doesn't actually have a numpad, but lets me set up "meta" bindings.

Windows "Mouse keys" is simply too slow, and third party solutions I've tried don't work on Windows 11 or have weird acceleration issues. So, I made this.

## Features
- Control mouse cursor with numpad buttons
- Numpad keys: <kbd>8</kbd> = Up, <kbd>6</kbd> = Right, <kbd>2</kbd> = Down, <kbd>4</kbd> = Left
- Starts moving at 1 pixel per tick, will accelerate to 10 pixels per tick
- Numpad button presses will be blocked once handled

💡 **Pro-tip:** Turn Num Lock on for this tool to work properly.
